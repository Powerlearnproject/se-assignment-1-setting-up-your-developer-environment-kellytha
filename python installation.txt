Locate the downloaded file (usually in your Downloads folder) named something like python-x.x.x.exe.
Double-click the installer to run it.
Customize Installation (Optional):

On the first screen, check the box that says "Add Python x.x to PATH".
Click "Customize installation" if you want to choose optional features or install location, otherwise, click "Install Now".
Install Python:

Follow the installer prompts. This includes choosing optional features (like pip and IDLE) and specifying the installation directory.
Wait for the installation to complete.
Verify the Installation:

Open Command Prompt (press Win+R, type cmd, and hit Enter).
Type python --version and press Enter to check the Python version.
Type pip --version to check if pip (Python package installer) is installed correctly.
